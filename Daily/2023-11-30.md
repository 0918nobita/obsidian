### Memorize rendering content by segment
Currently, the code block processor of this plugin always calls the `pinyin` function of `pinyin-pro` with the entire sentence as an argument and adjusts the width after the actually render.

However, since this slows down the rendering performance, I'm thinking of dividing an input sentence into segments that can be passed separately to the `pinyin` function without any problem, and then memorizing the information about the layout obtained at the first rendering.

There are two types of segments.
One is `zh` segment. It's a sequence of Chinese characters cut out as long as possible.
The other is `nonZh` segment. It's a sequence of non-Chinese characters cut out as long as possible.
